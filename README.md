Music has played a substantial role in enriching human lives from the early stages of civilization and before. 
While this role has endured, music consumption habits have been constantly evolving through ages. Rapid digitalization of musical records has significantly modified 
the music consumption habits by giving birth to online Music streaming services. 
A huge decline in sales of physical copies of music records is a strong indication that Music streaming platforms are already shaping the music listening experience of humans. 
With already a huge digital market in the Music industry been established, many music giants like Spotify, YouTube, Apple, and Amazon have already made the music industry very competitive.
This study intends to identify the factors that significantly influence consumer’s choice & usage of Music streaming service, 
highlighting each platform’s strengths and weaknesses. An extended version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) was applied to identify such 
significant factors and to compare the relative performance of each streaming platform under each influencing factor. 

Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) & Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to statistically model this framework using the data collected from a survey with 249 responses.
My findings confirm that factors such as Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Price-value, and Perceived premium-freemium fit significantly influence consumer’s 
choices of Music streaming services and their intention to purchase a premium version. The results also highlight the strengths and weakness of the platforms studied 
(Amazon & Apple music, Spotify, and YouTube) with Spotify demonstrating more strengths compared to the competitors.
